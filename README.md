# Waze User Churn Prediction Project

## About Waze
Waze is a popular navigation app owned by Google that helps drivers navigate effectively. The appâ€™s community of users, map editors, beta testers, translators, and partners contribute to making the driving experience safer and more efficient.

## Churn vs. Retained Users
- **Churn:** Users who have uninstalled the Waze app or stopped using it.
- **Retained:** Users who continue to actively use the app.

---

## Project Objective
The goal of this project was to build a machine learning model that predicts user churn. A successful model would not only help reduce churn but also aid in improving user retention, thus contributing to Waze's growth.

---

## Project Overview
The project focused on analyzing user churn dynamics and creating a predictive model to improve user retention. The approach included data exploration, hypothesis testing, and model development to provide actionable insights for business growth.

## Key Steps Taken

### 1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
- Performed an extensive exploration of the dataset, addressing missing data, distribution skewness, and feature engineering.
- Handled outliers by setting appropriate percentile thresholds to maintain data quality and integrity.

### 2. **Statistical Analysis & Hypothesis Testing**
- Conducted a two-sample T-test to compare ride frequencies between iPhone and Android users.
- Used Chi-squared testing to uncover significant relationships between categorical variables (such as user behavior across devices).

### 3. **Model Development**
- Developed machine learning models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost) for churn prediction.
- Employed feature engineering and a three-way data split (training, validation, and test sets) to ensure robust and generalizable model performance.

## Conclusion
This project combined data exploration, hypothesis testing, and machine learning techniques to create a model capable of predicting user churn. The insights derived from the model are essential for improving user retention and supporting business growth at Waze.
